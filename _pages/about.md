<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm currently a second-year master student at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m a member of the CMU [Catalyst research group](https://catalyst.cs.cmu.edu/), and am fortunate to work under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Zhijao Jia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhihaoj2/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning systems** and **large language models**. I believe that research and engineering, systems and algorithms are equally indispensable in this exciting era of LLM. Currently, my primary work involves breaking the boundaries of traditional kernels by fusing them into a "megakernel" to push hardware utilization to the limit.

Prior to CMU, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Peking University, where I worked with [Prof. Tong Yang](https://yangtonghome.github.io/) on network system and advanced algorithms for data stream.
